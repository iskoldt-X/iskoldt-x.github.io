description: "The very first post of mine."
---
On 2017, I built my first website. I was 20 years old, a total newbie, but somehow I bought a server and installed [LNMP](https://lnmp.org/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) on it. Back then I named myself Adam, so I bought a domain `adamdad.cn`. I don't know exactly when, I found that my given name, which means `ice cold` is so cool, so I bought a new domain `icecoland.com` and keep it till this day. 

Today, I decide to shift my website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with the theme [Adam Blog 2.0](https://github.com/the-mvm/the-mvm.github.io). 

For the memory of my old website, I hereby bring my very first post to you:

**世界，你好！**

So, 这是我的第一篇博客文章，通过好基友大熊的帮助，我磕磕绊绊地终于建好了这个小站点。嘿嘿，我一定会珍惜它的。在这里借用之前见到过的一句话：

***生命不息，折腾不止。***

（虽然我觉得自己已经老了，折腾不动了吧。。。）（文章题图我用的是baby Stig~ ）ᕙ(`▿´)ᕗ

Anyway, hello, world!
