# Using AI to Generate Video

Today's date is June 8, 2023. As technology continues to evolve, so too do the tools that we use for content creation. One such tool that's been making waves is HeyGen, a plugin for ChatGPT that enables users to generate videos using artificial intelligence (AI). This post will talk about my experiences with HeyGen, and how I used it to generate a perfect introduction video for Silo in both English and Chinese.

## What is HeyGen?

HeyGen is a plugin for ChatGPT, a powerful AI model developed by OpenAI. It's capable of understanding and generating text based on prompts provided by users. But HeyGen takes this capability a step further by enabling ChatGPT to generate videos as well.

With HeyGen, you can simply describe the video you want to create, and the AI will do the rest. It's an incredibly powerful tool that simplifies the video creation process, making it more accessible to everyone.

## Generating Talking Videos in English and Chinese

I recently had the opportunity to try out HeyGen for myself. My task was to generate an introduction video for Silo, and I wanted to create versions in both English and Chinese.

I described the video I wanted to create to HeyGen, providing it with information about Silo and the key points that I wanted to highlight in the video. To my surprise, HeyGen managed to generate a perfect video in both languages. The videos were engaging, informative, and exactly what I had in mind.
